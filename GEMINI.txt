Gemini DeepMind
Gemini will be of three sizes
1. Gemini Ultra (The most capable and largest model for highly complex tasks)
2. Gemini Pro (Best performing model for a broader range of tasks)
3. Gemini Nano(Most efficient model for on-device tasks)

Gemini is the first AI model to almost outperform human experts on MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding), one of the most popular methods to test the knowledge 
and problem solving abilities of AI models.
